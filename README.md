       #README
In MyReads project,  I installed all project dependencies with npm install and started the dependencies with npm start.
I created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books I have #read, am currently reading, or want to read.## The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that I will use to persist information as I interact with the application. You can move from the main page and a search page by one button.
